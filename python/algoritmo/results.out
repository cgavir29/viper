it doesnt seem to ever stop but after this point the avg fiterinos
start fluctuating, interestingly, this seems to have revitalized the movement of the champ, as it for example took a leap a little bit later from 13709 to 13747, however it would also seem that it takes more and more gens of decreasing to get a net gain, after gen 156 it seems to be stuck





NEXT: TRY ALL OF THESE WITH A HIGHER MUTATION RATE= 0.1%
